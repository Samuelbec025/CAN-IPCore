## CAN Bus Transceiver Core (Verilog) Flowchart:

**Start**

1. **Define Requirements:**
    - Specify CAN bus bit rate (e.g., 500 kbps, 1 Mbps).
    - Choose a CAN transceiver IC (e.g., MCP2515, SN65HVD23x).

2. **Design CAN Controller Modules:**
    - **Bit Timing Module:**
        - Calculate Baud Rate Prescaler (BRP) and Synchronization Jump Width (SJW) based on requirements.
        - Generate control signals for Transmit and Receive logic based on bit timing.
    - **Frame Handling Module:**
        - Parse standard/extended IDs from received frames.
        - Handle data field (up to 8 bytes) for data frames.
        - Implement CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) calculation.
        - Perform bit stuffing and destuffing.
    - **Transmit Logic Module:**
        - Manage data transmission onto the CAN bus.
        - Implement CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) for arbitration.
        - Handle retransmission logic for errors.
        - Interface with CAN Transceiver Interface Module.
    - **Receive Logic Module:**
        - Capture data from the CAN bus.
        - Perform bit unstuffing.
        - Verify CRC of received data.
        - Extract information from the frame (ID, data, type).

3. **Design CAN Transceiver Interface Module:**
    - **Transceiver Control Module:**
        - Manage control pins of the CAN transceiver IC (mode, loopback, etc.).
    - **Data Exchange Module:**
        - Read data from CAN transceiver receive pins (CANH, CANL).
        - Send data to CAN transceiver transmit pins (CANH, CANL).

4. **Develop Test Bench:**
    - Stimulate CAN controller modules with test vectors (frames).
    - Verify module functionality (ID parsing, CRC, data handling).

5. **Integration and Verification:**
    - Integrate modules with CAN Transceiver Interface Module (initially simulated).
    - Connect modules with appropriate signals.
    - Refine design based on test bench results.

6. **FPGA Implementation:**
    - Synthesize Verilog code to generate FPGA configuration file.
    - Program the FPGA with the configuration file.
    - Integrate physical CAN transceiver IC with the FPGA board.

7. **Testing and Validation:**
    - Test the CAN transceiver core on a real CAN bus network.
    - Validate data transmission and reception functionality.
    - Verify error handling mechanisms.

8. **Optimization (Optional):**
    - Consider pipelining and state encoding for performance improvement.
    - Analyze resource utilization and optimize code if necessary.
